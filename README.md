# DSA-With-Dhrumil
# DSA Preparation from Scratch

Welcome to the DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Preparation repository! This course is designed to develop your programming skills from basic to intermediate levels through a structured approach to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Introduction

This repository provides a systematic path for learning DSA, enhancing your problem-solving and logical thinking abilities. It is tailored for beginners starting from scratch and guides them to an intermediate level of proficiency.

## Getting Started

To begin your DSA preparation journey, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-preparation.git
   cd dsa-preparation
   ```

2. **Explore the folders to find problems and solutions organized by topic.**

3. **Start solving problems in sequence to build a solid foundation.**

## Topics Covered

This repository covers the following essential topics:

1. **Basic Data Structures:**
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists
   - Stacks
   - Queues

2. **Basic Algorithms:**
   - Sorting (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, etc.)
   - Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)

3. **Intermediate Data Structures:**
   - Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree)
   - Graphs (Representation, Traversal Techniques)
   - Hash Tables

4. **Intermediate Algorithms:**
   - Dynamic Programming
   - Greedy Algorithms
   - Divide and Conquer
